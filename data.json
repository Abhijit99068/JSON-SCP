    "Discription":"SCP-002 resembles a tumorous, fleshy growth with a volume of roughly 60 m³ (or 2000 ft³). An iron valve hatch on one side leads to its interior, which appears to be a standard low-rent apartment of modest size. One wall of the room possesses a single window, though no such opening is visible from the exterior. The room contains furniture which, upon close examination, appears to be sculpted bone, woven hair, and various other biological substances produced by the human body. All matter tested thus far show independent or fragmented DNA sequences for each object in the room.",
    "containtment": "SCP-002 is to remain connected to a suitable power supply at all times, to keep it in what appears to be a recharging mode. In case of electrical outage, the emergency barrier between the object and the facility is to be closed and the immediate area evacuated. Once facility power is re-established, alternating bursts of X-ray and ultraviolet light must strobe the area until SCP-002 is re-affixed to the power supply and returned to recharging mode. Containment area is to be kept at negative air pressure at all times."

    "objectclass":"Euclid",
    "Discription":"S-003 CPconsists of two related components of separate origin, referred to as SCP-003-1 and SCP-003-2.",
    "containtment": "SCP-003 is a anomalous object that must be kept at a minimum temperature of 35°C, with the preferred temperature being above 100°C, and cannot be allowed to come into contact with complex multicellular organisms. In the event of a power failure, personnel must maintain skin contact with SCP-003-1 to prevent it from increasing mass until power is restored. Personnel entering its containment area must be checked for body parasites and sterilized if necessary, and anyone in contact with SCP-003-1 must be sterilized afterwards. SCP-003-1 should not be removed from SCP-003-2 except in emergencies, and any changes in SCP-003-2's rune activity must be reported promptly. SCP-003-2 must be supplied with power at all times from Generator 003-IX."

    "Discription":"SCP-004 consists of an old wooden barn door (SCP-004-1) and a set of twelve rusted steel keys (SCP-004-2 through SCP-004-13). The door itself is the entrance to an abandoned factory in [DATA EXPUNGED].",
    "containtment": " SCP-003, an anomalous object, must be maintained at temperatures above 35°C and preferably above 100°C, while avoiding contact with complex multicellular organisms. In case of power failure, personnel must maintain skin contact with SCP-003-1 to prevent mass increase until power is restored. Those entering its containment area are checked for body parasites and sterilized if necessary, with subsequent sterilization required for anyone in contact with SCP-003-1. SCP-003-1 should only be removed from SCP-003-2 in emergencies, with any changes in SCP-003-2's rune activity requiring prompt reporting. Continuous power supply to SCP-003-2 via Generator 003-IX is imperative for containment."

    "objectclass":"Safe",
    "Discription":"In appearance, SCP-005 resembles an ornate key, displaying the characteristics of a typical mass produced key used in the 1920s. The key was discovered when a civilian used it to infiltrate a high security facility. SCP-005 seems to have the unique ability to open any and all forms of lock (See Appendix A), be they mechanical or digital, with relative ease. The origin of this ability has yet to be determined.</p>",
    "containtment": "SCP-005 poses no immediate risk in any direct sense. Even so, its unique functions require special measures be taken to restrict access and manipulation of the object. Approval of at least one (1) Level 4 personnel is required for the removal of the object from its containment area."

    "item": "SCP-006",
    "objectclass":"Safe",
    "Discription":"SCP-006 is a very small spring located 60 km west of Astrakhan. Foundation Command was aware of its existence since the 19th century, but were unable to secure it until 1991 due to political reasons. On the spot of the spring, a chemical factory has been constructed as a disguise, with the majority of laborers under Foundation and/or Russian control. The liquid emitted from the spring has been chemically identified as simple mineral water in 1902, but has the unusual property of health.",
    "containtment": "SCP-006, while not requiring extensive containment, demands secrecy concerning its existence and effects. Personnel interacting with SCP-006 must wear modified Class VI BNC suits and undergo briefing with Material SCP-006B or SCP-006C, restricted to O5 clearance. Suit integrity is ensured through submersion tests. Procedures involving SCP-006 are strictly monitored, with Procedure 006-Xi-12 signaling perceived high toxicity and evacuation. Acquisition of SCP-006 liquid requires approval from three O5 level personnel and transfer in Quad-Sealant Containers under armed guard. Contact with SCP-006 mandates confinement and termination, with incineration deemed the most effective method post-study. (Refer to file SCP006-TerO5 for detailed report.)"
